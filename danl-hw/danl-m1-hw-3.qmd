```


# Direction

-   Write a Python code to answer each question.

-   Make at least some simple comment (`# ...`) in each question.

-   Use your working directory with the subfolder, `data`, so that the relative pathname of CSV files in the subfolder `data` is sufficient to import the CSV files.

# Load Libraries

-   Import all the Python libraries we need here.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
import pandas as pd
```

# Question 1

-   Consider the probability of survival in `titanic_1.csv`.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
titanic_1 = pd.read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/titanic_1.csv')
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
titanic_1.head()
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
titanic_1.describe()
```

## Q1a

-   Calculate the simple difference between the probability of survival when passengers are first-class and the probability of survival when they are not.

# title-block-banner: true

    theme: clean

## Q1b

-   How much does the probability of survival increase for first-class passengers relative to those who are not first-class passengers?

-   `SDP` tells us what would happen to the probability of survival if non-first-class passengers were first-class.

    -   In other words, `SDP` means the effect of being the first-class on the probability of survival from the Titanic Disaster.

## Q1c

-   Consider the probability of survival in `titanic_2.csv`.

```{python}
titanic_2 = pd.read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/titanic_2.csv')
```

```{python}
titanic_2.head()
```

```{python}
titanic_2.describe()
```

-   After stratifying on gender and age, what happens to the difference in the probabilities of survival between first-class passengers and non-first-class passengers?

-   Explain in your own words what stratifying on gender and age did for this difference in probabilities of survival between first-class passengers and non-first-class passengers.

*Answer*

```{python}

```


# Question 2

-   Consider the data file, `NHL-1617.csv`.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
nhl1617 = pd.read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/NHL-1617.csv')
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
nhl1617.head()
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
nhl1617.describe()
```

## Q2a

-   How many players have been recorded?
<br>

*Answer*

```{python}

```



## Q2b.

-   A column `points` ("`P`") is missing in the data. The number of points of a player is defined as the sum of his goals ("`G`") and `assists` ("`A`").

-   Add the point column "`P`" to your DataFrame.
<br>

*Answer*

```{python}

```



## Q2c.

-   Who is the top scorer in terms of points?
<br>

*Answer*

```{python}

```



## Q2d.

-   How many Russian (non-goalie) players had some ice time in there 2016/2017 regular season?

-   Hint: Nationality of a player can be found in "Nat". Russians are indicated by "RUS".
<br>

*Answer*

```{python}

```



## Q2e.

-   What are their names?
<br>

*Answer*

```{python}

```



## Q2f.

-   Who performed best among the Russian players in terms of points ("`P`")?
<br>

*Answer*

```{python}

```



## Q2g.

-   How many points ("`P`") did he have?
<br>

*Answer*

```{python}

```



## Q2h.

-   How well did he perform in the entire league? Put differently, what was his rank in terms of points?
<br>

*Answer*

```{python}

```



## Q2i.

-   Find the top ten scorers (in terms of points) and print them including their number of point and their respective team.
<br>

*Answer*

```{python}

```



## Q2j.

-   What are the three countries with the most players originating from?
<br>

*Answer*

```{python}

```



# Question 3

-   Consider the data file, `coal_production_county.csv`.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
coal = pd.read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/coal_production_county.csv')
```

## Q3a.

-   For each type of mine, calculate the total coal production for each pair of state-year.
<br>

*Answer*

```{python}

```


## Q3b.

-   Find the top 5 coal-producing states for each year.
<br>

*Answer*

```{python}

```



## Q3c.

-   Visualize the yearly trend of the total coal production from each type of mine.
<br>

*Answer*

```{python}

```
