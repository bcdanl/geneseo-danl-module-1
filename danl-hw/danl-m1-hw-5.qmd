# Direction


- Please submit your Jupyter Notebook for Homework 5 to the Brightspace with the name below:

  - `danl-m1-hw5-LASTNAME-FIRSTNAME.ipynb`\
  ( e.g., `danl-m1-hw5-choe-byeonghak.ipynb` )

- The due is March 12, 2024, 7:00 P.M.

- Please send Byeong-Hak an email (`bchoe@geneseo.edu`) if you have any questions.

-   Please prepare a Jupyter/Python Notebook (`*.ipynb`) to address all questions.

-   Make at least some simple comment (`# ...`) in each question.

-   Make one text cell to explain things in each question.

Import the `pandas` library, and read `fao_stat.csv` as `fao`:

```{python}
#| echo: true
import pandas as pd

fao = pd.read_csv("https://bcdanl.github.io/data/fao_stat.csv",
                  encoding = 'ISO-8859-1')
```


## Variable Description
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/fao-logo.png" width="500px">
</p>


The `fao` `DataFrame` contains the country-year level observation regarding variables below:


- `SSA`: A boolean indicating if the country is in Sub-Saharan Africa.
- `Area`: The name of the country.
- `Year`: The year of observation.
- `gdp_per_capita`: GDP per capita.
- `drinking_water`: The percentage of the population with access to safe drinking water.
- `sanitation_service`: The percentage of the population with access to improved sanitation services.
- `children_stunted`: The percentage of children under 5 years old who are stunted.
- `children_overweight`: The percentage of children under 5 years old who are overweight.
- `investment_pct`: The percentage of GDP invested in public health.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
rmarkdown::paged_table(readr::read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/fao_stat.csv')
          )
```


<br><br>

## Question 1

What percentage of the values is missing for each variable?



*Answer*
```{python}

```

<br><br>

<br><br>


## Question 2
Fill missing values in the `gdp_per_capita` variable with the mean value of that variable.


*Answer*
```{python}

```

<br><br>




## Question 3
Drop observations where `drinking_water` or `sanitation_service` information is missing.


*Answer*
```{python}

```

<br><br>



## Question 4
What is the average `drinking_water` access percentage for each `Area` grouped by `SSA` status?


*Answer*
```{python}

```

<br><br>



## Question 5
Calculate the mean `sanitation_service` percentage for each combination of `SSA` status and `Year`.

*Hint*: We can group a `DataFrame` by a list of multiple variables. Then, each group corresponds to a unique combination of values across the specified variables.

```{python}
#| eval: false
(
  fao
  .groupby(['VARIABLE_1', 'VARIABLE_2'])
)
```

*Answer*
```{python}

```

<br><br>




## Question 6
For each year, find the 5 worst countries in terms of `drinking_water`.

- *Hint*: We can start with the `sort_values()` method.
- *Note*: `DataFrameGroupBy` does not support the `sort_values()` method.


```{python}
#| eval: false


```


*Answer*
```{python}

```

<br><br>





## Question 7
For each year, find the 5 worst countries in terms of `children_stunted`.


*Answer*
```{python}

```
