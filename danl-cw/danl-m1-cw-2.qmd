## Q1f
- Variable `price_per_floz` is continuous.
- Variable `brand` is categorical.

Describe the distribution of `price_per_floz` for each `brand` using `seaborn`.

Make a simple comment on comparison for the distribution of `price_per_floz` across brands.
<br>

*Answer*

```{python}

```

```{r}

```

<br>

- `BUD LIGHT`, `COORS LIGHT`, and `MILLER LITE` have the similar distribution of `price_per_floz` with each other.
