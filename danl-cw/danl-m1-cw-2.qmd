The `nfl.csv` file (with its pathname `https://bcdanl.github.io/data/nfl.csv`) contains a list of players in the National Football League with similar `Name`, `Team`, `Position`, `Birthday`, and `Salary` variables in the `nfl.csv` file. 



```{python}
#| echo: true
import pandas as pd
```

<!-- <div style="position: relative;"> -->
<!--   <button onclick="scrollTable(-200)" style="position: absolute; z-index: 1000; top: 0; left: 70px; border: 1px solid grey; width: 25px; height: 40px; background-color: #ededed;">‚Üê</button> -->

<!-- </div> -->


<script>
function scrollTable(offset) {
  // Ensure we're targeting the scroll body of the DataTable specifically
  var scrollBody = $('#exampleTable .dataTables_scrollBody');
  
  // Check if the scrollBody is found
  console.log(scrollBody.length); // For debugging, should be 1 if found
  
  scrollBody.animate({
    scrollLeft: '+=' + offset
  }, 'fast');
}
</script>
