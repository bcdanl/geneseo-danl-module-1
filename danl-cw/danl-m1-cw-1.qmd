# Part II - Introduction to Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax. Its main goal is to be readable and easy to write, even when viewed as plain text. Markdown is widely used for creating formatted text on the web and in various applications such as Jupyter Notebooks in Google Colab. 

## Basic Syntax

### Headings
Headings are created by adding one or more `#` symbols before your heading text. The number of `#` symbols indicates the level of the heading.

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

### Emphasis
You can make text **bold** by wrapping it with two asterisks `**`, and *italic* by using one asterisk `*`.

```markdown
*italic* or _italic_
**bold** or __bold__
```

### Lists
Unordered lists are created using `*`, `-`, or `+`, while ordered lists are numbered.

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2
```

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
```

### Links and Images
Links are created using `[Link Text](URL)`, and images with `![Alt Text](Image URL)`.

```markdown
[DANL 210](https://bcdanl.github.io/210)
![Geneseo Logo](https://bcdanl.github.io/img/geneseo-logo.gif)
```

## Advanced Syntax

### Blockquote

```markdown
> Be yourself. Everyone else is already taken. - Oscar Wilde.
```


### Emojis

- A ton of markdown emojis are available here :smile: ( `:smile:` )
  - [https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet)



### Code Blocks
Code blocks are created by using triple backticks (```). Optionally, you can specify the language for syntax highlighting.


````markdown
```
"string"
```
````

````markdown
```python
# Python code block
import numpy as np
```
````


## Question 6

- Do the following tasks on this Classwork 1 Discussion Board:
  1. **Basic Syntax**: Write a comment with your name, a heading, an unordered list, an ordered list, a link, and an image.
  2. **Advanced Syntax**: Write a comment that includes a Python code block, a blockquote, and an emoji.
