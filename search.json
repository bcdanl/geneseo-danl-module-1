We can replace the missing value with another value, 2. We can fill in the cells with the missing value using existing value, 3. We can drop the observations with missing values from our DataFrame.\n\n\n\nWe can use the .fillna() method to recode the missing values to another value.\n\n## fill the missing values to 0\nebola0 = ebola.fillna(0)\n\n\n\nWe can use built-in methods to fill forward (method = ffill).\n\nWhen we fill data forward, the last known value (from top to bottom) is used for the next missing value.\n\n\nebola_f = ebola.fillna(method='ffill')\n\n\n\nWe can also use built-in methods to fill backward (method = bfill).\n\nWhen we fill data backward, the newest value (from top to bottom) is used to replace the missing data.\n\n\nebola_b = ebola.fillna(method='bfill')\n\n\n\nInterpolation uses existing values to fill in missing values.\n\nBy default, .interpolate() treats the missing values as if they should be equally spaced apart.\n\nebola_linear = ebola.interpolate()\nThe .interpolate() method behaves kind of in a forward fill fashion.\n\n\n\nIf we want to keep the observations with only non-missing values, we can use .dropna()\nebola_dropna = ebola.dropna()\nWe are left with just one row of data!\n\n\nSuppose we wanted to look at the case counts for multiple regions.\n\n\nebola[\"Cases_multiple\"] = (\n  ebola[\"Cases_Guinea\"]\n  + ebola[\"Cases_Liberia\"]\n  + ebola[\"Cases_SierraLeone\"]\n)\n\nebola_subset = ebola.loc[:,\n    [\"Cases_Guinea\", \n     \"Cases_Liberia\", \n     \"Cases_SierraLeone\",\n     \"Cases_multiple\"] ]\n\n\n\n\n.mean() and .sum() can ignore missing values. - These functions will typically have a skipna parameter that will still calculate a value by skipping over the missing values.\nebola.Cases_Guinea.sum(skipna = True) ## default\nebola.Cases_Guinea.sum(skipna = False)"

Residents and tourists can pick up and drop off bicycles at hundreds of locations around the city. Ride data is publicly available and released monthly by the city at https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data. citibike.csv is a collection of ~1.9 million rides that cyclists took in June 2020. For simplicity’s sake, the data set has been modified from its original version and includes only two columns: each ride’s start time and end time. Let’s import the data set and assign it to a citi_bike variable:\n\nciti_bike = pd.read_csv(\"citibike.csv\")\n\n\n\nQuestion 1\nConvert the start_time and stop_time columns to store datetime (Timestamp) values instead of strings.\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\nCount the rides that occurred on each day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, and so on). Which weekday is the most popular for a bike ride? Use the start_time column as your starting point.\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\nCount the rides per week for each week within the month. To do so, round each date in the start_time column to its previous or current Monday. Assume that each week starts on a Monday and ends on a Sunday. Thus, the first week of June would be Monday, June 1 through Sunday, June 7.\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\nCalculate the duration of each ride, and save the results to a new duration column.\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\nFind the average duration of a bike ride.\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\nExtract the five longest bike rides by duration from the data set.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
