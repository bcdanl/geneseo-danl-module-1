# GitHub and Google Colab {background-color="#1c4982"}

## What is GitHub?
- [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) is a platform for storing, managing, and sharing code. 

- Course contents will be posted not only Brightspace but also our GitHub repositories ("repos").

- Online discussion and Q & A will be hosted on GitHub repository.

- Clicking "Sign Up" or [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup) will direct you to the sign up page.



## Getting a GitHub account

Github is useful for many reasons, but the main reason is how user friendly it makes uploading and sharing code.

Sharing and editing code for a large group is easy with Github

It also automatically maintains a history of all changes to the repo. 
You can see the history of committed changes, and even go into detail about what those changes entailed. 

You can also revert to old versions of your repo, and all edits will be saved in this history.


## What is Google Colab
- [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/) is analogous to Google Drive, but specifically for writing and
executing Python code in your browser.
  - The base Colab link listed above leads to a Python notebook introducing Colab and how to use it.

- This video also helps get started with Colab if you are unfamiliar with the format!
  - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI)


## Why use Colab?
- A key benefit of Colab is that it is entirely free to use and has many of the standard Python modules pre installed. 
  - It allows for CPU or GPU usage, even for free users, and stores the files in Google’s servers so you can access your files from anywhere you can connect to the Internet.
  
- Using Colab also means you can entirely avoid the process of installing Python and any dependencies onto your computer.

- Colab notebooks don’t just contain Python code. They can contain text, images, and HTML!

- Ultimately, they’re intuitive to use and let you jump right into the code and data analysis without needing to worry about the more cumbersome details needed to run Python notebooks on a laptop or PC.


## Colab has GitHub integration!



# Installing the Tools {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Installing the Tools
### Anaconda

- Anaconda is an all-in-one Python distribution.
  - Anaconda includes Python 3.x and its standard modules such as pip, pandas, matplotlib, etc.
  - Anaconda also includes several software applications of integrated development environment (IDE), which is a software for editing codes.
  - For the Python code, we will use **Spyder** IDE.  
    - Do not use RStudio from Anaconda, because RStudio from Anaconda is out-dated.

  
- To install Anaconda, go to the following download page:
  - [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
  - Click the "Download" button.



## Installing the Tools
### Spyder IDE

- If Spyder IDE from Anaconda is lagging, consider installing it additionally.
  
- To install Spyder IDE in addition to Anaconda, go to the following download page:
  i. [https://www.spyder-ide.org](https://www.spyder-ide.org).
  ii. Click the "DOWNLOAD" menu.

## Coding Workflow
### Code and comment style
- The two main principles for coding and managing data are:
  - Make things easier for your future self.
  - Don't trust your future self.

- The `#` mark is Spyder's comment character.
  - `#` indicates that the rest of the line is to be ignored.
  - Write comments before the line that you want the comment to apply to.

- Consider using block commenting for separating code sections.
  - `# %%` defines a coding block in Spyder.

- Break down long lines and long algebraic expressions.

# Python Basics {background-color="#1c4982"}



##  Python Basics
### Values, Variables, and Types

- A **value** is datum (literal) such as a number or text. 

- There are different **types** of values: 352.3 is known as a *float* or *double*, 22 is an *integer*, and “Hello World!” is a *string*. 

- A **variable** is a name that refers to a value.
  - We can think of a **variable** as a box that has a value, or multiple values, packed inside it.


```{.python}
a = 10
print(a)
```



##  Python Basics
### Values, Variables, and Types

- Sometimes you will hear variables referred to as **objects**.

- Everything that is not a literal value, such as 10, is an *object*. 




##  Python Basics
### Assignment

- In Python, we use `=` to assign a value to a variable.

```{.python}
# Here we assign the integer value 5 to the variable x.
x = 5   

# Now we can use the variable x in the next line.
y = x + 12  
y
```

- In math, `=` means *equality* of both sides.
- In programs, `=` means **assignment**: *assign the value on the right side to the variable on the left side*.



##  Python Basics
### Assignment


- In programs, everything on the right side needs to have a value.
  - The right side can be a literal value, or a variable that has already been assigned a value, or a combination.
  
- When Python reads `y = x + 12`, it does the following:
  - Sees the `=` in the middle.
  - Knows that this is an assignment.
  - Calculates the right side (gets the value of the object referred to by `x` and adds it to `12`).
  - Assigns the result to the left-side variable, `y`.





##  Python Basics
### Variables Are Names, Not Places

- In Python, *variables* are just names.


```{r}
#| eval: true
#| out-width: "29%"
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| fig-cap: "Names point to objects (variable `a` points to an integer object with value `7`)"

knitr::include_graphics("lec_figs/int-py-fig2-3.png")
```


##  Python Basics
### Variables Are Names, Not Places

- The most basic built-in data types that you’ll need to know about are: **integers** 10, **floats** 1.23, **strings** like this, **booleans** True, and **nothing** None.

- Python also has a built-in type called a **list** [10, 15, 20] that can *contain* anything, even different **types** 

```{.python}
list_example = [10, 1.23, "like this", True, None]
print(list_example)
type(list_example)
```





##  Python Basics
### Types

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| fig-cap: "Python’s basic data types"

knitr::include_graphics("lec_figs/int-py-tab2-1.png")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- The second column (Type) contains the Python name of that type. 

- The third column (Mutable?) indicates whether the value can be changed after creation.
:::
::::




##  Python Basics
### Brackets

- There are several kinds of brackets in Python, including `[]`, `{}`, and `()`. 


::: {.panel-tabset}

## `[]`
- `[]` is used to denote a **list** or to signify accessing a *position* using an index.

```{.python}
vector = ['a', 'b']
vector[0]
```





## `{}`
- `{}` is used to denote a **set** or a **dictionary** (with key-value pairs).

```{.python}
{'a', 'b'}
{'first_letter': 'a', 'second_letter': 'b'}
```




## `()`
- `()` is used to denote a **tuple**, or the *arguments* to a *function*, e.g., function(x)  where x is the input passed to the function, or to indicate the order operations are carried out.

```{.python}
num_tup = (1, 2, 3)
sum(num_tup)
```



:::



##  Python Basics
### Lists and Slicing

- Lists are a really useful way to work with lots of data at once. 
  - We can also construct them by appending entries:

```{.python}
list_example = [10, 1.23, "like this", True, None]
list_example.append("one more entry")
print(list_example)
```

- We can access earlier entries using an *index*, which begins at 0 and ends at one less than the length of the list.

```{.python}
print(list_example[0])
print(list_example[-1])
```




##  Python Basics
### Lists and Slicing

- Slicing can be even more elaborate than that because we can jump entries using a second colon. 

```{.python}
# range() produces a list of integers from the value to one less than the last
list_of_numbers = list(range(1, 11))
start = 1
stop = -1
step = 2
print(list_of_numbers[ start : stop : step ])
```




##  Python Basics
### Operators

- All of the basic operators you see in mathematics are available to use: `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, `*` for multiplication, `**` for powers, `/` for division, `//` for integer division, and `%` for modulo.

  i. These work as you’d expect on numbers. 
  i. These operators are sometimes defined for other built-in data types too. 
    - We can ‘sum’ strings (which really concatenates them):

```{.python}
string_one = "This is an example "
string_two = "of string concatenation"
string_full = string_one + string_two
print(string_full)
```



##  Python Basics
### Operators

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- It works for lists too:

```{.python}
list_one = ["apples", "oranges"]
list_two = ["pears", "satsumas"]
list_full = list_one + list_two
print(list_full)
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- We can multiply strings!

```{.python}
string = "apples, "
print(string * 3)
```

:::
::::



##  Python Basics
### Operators

- We can combine the arithmetic operators with assignment by putting the operator before the `=`.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- `x += 1` is equivalent to `x = x + 1`.
```{.python}
x = 3
x += 1
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- `a -= 2` is equivalent to `a = a - 2`.
```{.python}
a = 2
a -= 2
```
:::
:::: 



##  Python Basics
### Operators

**Q**. Using Python operations only, what is
$$\frac{2^5}{7 \cdot (4 - 2^3)} \quad\text{?}$$ 






##  Python Basics
### Strings

- From strings, we can access the individual characters via slicing and indexing. 


```{.python}
string = "cheesecake"
print( string[-4:] )
```


- Both lists and strings will allow us to use the `len()` command to get their length:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- `x += 1` is equivalent to `x = x + 1`.
```{.python}
string = "cheesecake"
print( "String has length:" )
print( len(string) )
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- `a -= 2` is equivalent to `a = a - 2`.
```{.python}
list_of_numbers = range(1, 20)
print( "List of numbers has length:" )
print( len(list_of_numbers) )
```
:::
::::



##  Python Basics
### f-string

- `f-string` can combine a number and a string (these begin with an `f` for formatting):
```{.python}
value = 20
sqrt_val = 20 ** 0.5
print(f"The square root of {value:d} is {sqrt_val:.2f}")
```

- The formatting command `:d` is an instruction to treat value like an *integer*, while `:.2f` is an instruction to print it like a *float* with 2 decimal places.





##  Python Basics
### Booleans and Conditions

- Boolean data have either `True` or `False` value.


- There are two types of operation that are associated with booleans: boolean operations.
  - Existing booleans are combined, and condition operations, which create a boolean when executed.



```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
text_tbl <- data.frame(
  Operator = c("x and y", "x or y", "not x"),
  Description = c("Are x and y both True?",
"Is at least one of x and y True?",
"Is x False?")
  )


kable(text_tbl, format = "html") %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = T) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T) %>%
  kable_styling(html_font = 'sans-serif, helvetica, arial',
                bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed") )

```



##  Python Basics
### Booleans and Conditions

Conditions are expressions that evaluate as booleans. 

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
text_tbl <- data.frame(
  Operator = c("x == y", "x != y", "x > y", "x >= y", "x < y", "x <= y", "x is y"),
  Description = c("Is x equal to y?",
"Is x greater than y?",
"Is x greater than or equal to y?",
"Is x greater than or equal to y?",
"Is x less than y?",
"Is x less than or equal to y?",
"Is x the same object as y?" )
)

kable(text_tbl, format = "html") %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = T) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T) %>%
  kable_styling(html_font = 'sans-serif, helvetica, arial',
                bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed") )

```



##  Python Basics
### Booleans and Conditions

- The `==` is an operator that compares the objects on either side and returns `True` if they have the same values

```{.python}
boolean_condition1 = 10 == 20
print(boolean_condition1)

boolean_condition2 = 10 == '10'
print(boolean_condition2)
```

**Q**. What does `not (not True)` evaluate to?





##  Python Basics
### Booleans and Conditions

- The real power of conditions comes when we start to use them in more complex examples, such as `if` statements.


```{.python}
name = "Geneseo"
score = 99

if name == "Geneseo" and score > 90:
    print("Geneseo, you achieved a high score.")

if name == "Geneseo" or score > 90:
    print("You could be called Geneseo or have a high score")

if name != "Geneseo" and score > 90:
    print("You are not called Geneseo and you have a high score")
```



##  Python Basics
### Booleans and Conditions

- Given that `==` and `!=` test for equality and not equal, respectively, you may be wondering what the keyword `is`  is for.
  - Remember that everything in Python is an object, and that values can be assigned to objects.
  - `==` and `!=` compare values, while `is` compare objects.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{.python}
name_list = ["Ada", "Adam"]
name_list_two = ["Ada", "Adam"]
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{.python}
# Compare values
print(name_list == name_list_two)

# Compare objects
print(name_list is name_list_two)
```
:::
::::



##  Python Basics
### Booleans and Conditions

- One of the most useful conditional keywords is `in`. 
  - This one must pop up ten times a day in most coders’ lives because it can pick out a variable or make sure something is where it’s supposed to be.


```{.python}
name_list = ["Lovelace", "Smith", "Hopper", "Babbage"]

print("Lovelace" in name_list)

print("Bob" in name_list)
```

**Q**. Check if “a” is in the string “Sun Devil Arena” using `in`. Is “a” in “Anyone”?




##  Python Basics
### Booleans and Conditions

- One conditional construct we're bound to use at some point, is the `if-else` chain:

```{.python}
score = 98

if score == 100:
    print("Top marks!")
elif score > 90 and score < 100:
    print("High score!")
elif score > 10 and score <= 90:
    pass
else:
    print("Better luck next time.")
```




##  Python Basics
### Booleans and Conditions


**Q**. Create a new `if-else` chain that prints “well done” if a score is over 90, “good” if between 40 and 90, and “bad luck” otherwise.






##  Python Basics
### Booleans and Conditions


- We can make multiple assignment or multiple boolean comparisons in a single line.


```{.python}
a, b = 3, 6

1 < a < b < 20
```



<script>
document.addEventListener('wheel', function(event) {
    if (event.deltaY > 0) {
        Reveal.next(); // Scroll down to go to the next slide
    } else {
        Reveal.prev(); // Scroll up to go to the previous slide
    }
}, false);
</script>
