## Syllabus
### Attendance
- You are allowed up to 7 absences without penalty. 

- There will be no additional absences available for standard excused reasons (illness, family emergency, transportation problems, etc.).



## Syllabus
### Grading
- Attendance accounts for 5% of the total percentage grade.

- Project accounts for 10% of the total percentage grade.

- Homework assignments account for 25% of the total percentage grade.

- Exams account for 60% of the total percentage grade.

$$ 
\begin{align}
&\;(\text{Total Percentage Grade})  \notag\\
=&\quad 0.05\times(\text{Attendance Score})  \notag\\
&\,+\, 0.35\times(\text{Total Homework Score}) \,+\, 0.60\times(\text{Total Exam Score}).\notag
\end{align}
$$


## Syllabus

### Grading

- The lowest homework score will be dropped when calculating the total homework score.

- Each of the four homework accounts for 20% of the total homework score.



## Syllabus

### Grading

- The total exam score is the maximum between the following two average scores:
  1. the simple average of two exam scores;
  2. the weighted average of them with one-fourth weight on the midterm exam score and three-fourth weight on the final exam score.
  
$$
\begin{align}
&(\text{Total Exam Score}) \notag\\
=\; &\max\,\left\{0.5\times(\text{Midterm Exam Score}) \,+\, 0.5\times(\text{Final Exam Score})\right.,\notag\\ 
&\qquad\;\,\left.0.25\times(\text{Midterm Exam Score}) \,+\, 0.75\times(\text{Final Exam Score})\right\}.\notag
\end{align}
$$



## Syllabus

### Grading

- Letter grades will be determined by the total percentage grade:
  
$$
\begin{align*}
\! 100\; \geq\; A\;\;\, \geq \;93>\; A- \geq 90;\\
90 >\; B+ \geq 87\; >\; B\;\;\, \geq \;83 >\; B- \geq 80;\\
80 >\; C+ \geq 77\; >\; C\;\;\, \geq \;73 >\; C- \geq 70;\\
70\; >\; D\;\;\, \geq\; 60 >\; E.\qquad\quad\;
\end{align*}
$$




## Syllabus

### Make-up exams

-  Make-up exams will not be given unless you have either a medically verified excuse or an absence excused by the University.

- If you cannot take exams because of religious obligations, notify me by email at least two weeks in advance so that an alternative exam time may be set.

- A missed exam without an excused absence earns a grade of zero.
  



## Syllabus

### Academic Integrity and Plagiarism

-  All homework assignments and exams must be the original work by you. 

- Examples of academic dishonesty include:
  - *representing the work, thoughts, and ideas of another person as your own*

# Installing the Tools {background-color="#40666e"}

## Installing the Tools
### Anaconda

- Anaconda is an all-in-one Python distribution.
  - Anaconda includes Python 3.x and its standard modules such as pip, pandas, matplotlib, etc.
  - Anaconda also includes several software applications of integrated development environment (IDE), which is a software for editing codes.
  - For the Python code, we will use **Spyder** IDE.  
    - Do not use RStudio from Anaconda, because RStudio from Anaconda is out-dated.

  
- To install Anaconda, go to the following download page:
  - [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
  - Click the "Download" button.



## Installing the Tools
### Spyder IDE

- If Spyder IDE from Anaconda is lagging, consider installing it additionally.
  
- To install Spyder IDE in addition to Anaconda, go to the following download page:
  i. [https://www.spyder-ide.org](https://www.spyder-ide.org).
  ii. Click the "DOWNLOAD" menu.

## Coding Workflow
### Code and comment style
- The two main principles for coding and managing data are:
  - Make things easier for your future self.
  - Don't trust your future self.

- The `#` mark is Spyder's comment character.
  - `#` indicates that the rest of the line is to be ignored.
  - Write comments before the line that you want the comment to apply to.

- Consider using block commenting for separating code sections.
  - `# %%` defines a coding block in Spyder.

- Break down long lines and long algebraic expressions.

# Python Basics {background-color="#40666e"}



##  Python Basics
### Values, Variables, and Types

- A **value** is datum (literal) such as a number or text. 

- There are different **types** of values: 352.3 is known as a *float* or *double*, 22 is an *integer*, and “Hello World!” is a *string*. 

- A **variable** is a name that refers to a value.
  - We can think of a **variable** as a box that has a value, or multiple values, packed inside it.


```{.python}
a = 10
print(a)
```



##  Python Basics
### Values, Variables, and Types

- Sometimes you will hear variables referred to as **objects**.

- Everything that is not a literal value, such as 10, is an *object*. 




##  Python Basics
### Assignment

- In Python, we use `=` to assign a value to a variable.

```{.python}
# Here we assign the integer value 5 to the variable x.
x = 5   

# Now we can use the variable x in the next line.
y = x + 12  
y
```

- In math, `=` means *equality* of both sides.
- In programs, `=` means **assignment**: *assign the value on the right side to the variable on the left side*.



##  Python Basics
### Assignment


- In programs, everything on the right side needs to have a value.
  - The right side can be a literal value, or a variable that has already been assigned a value, or a combination.
  
- When Python reads `y = x + 12`, it does the following:
  - Sees the `=` in the middle.
  - Knows that this is an assignment.
  - Calculates the right side (gets the value of the object referred to by `x` and adds it to `12`).
  - Assigns the result to the left-side variable, `y`.





##  Python Basics
### Variables Are Names, Not Places

- In Python, *variables* are just names.


```{r}
#| eval: true
#| out-width: "29%"
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| fig-cap: "Names point to objects (variable `a` points to an integer object with value `7`)"

knitr::include_graphics("lec_figs/int-py-fig2-3.png")
```


##  Python Basics
### Variables Are Names, Not Places

- The most basic built-in data types that you’ll need to know about are: **integers** 10, **floats** 1.23, **strings** like this, **booleans** True, and **nothing** None.

- Python also has a built-in type called a **list** [10, 15, 20] that can *contain* anything, even different **types** 

```{.python}
list_example = [10, 1.23, "like this", True, None]
print(list_example)
type(list_example)
```





##  Python Basics
### Types

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| fig-cap: "Python’s basic data types"

knitr::include_graphics("lec_figs/int-py-tab2-1.png")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- The second column (Type) contains the Python name of that type. 

- The third column (Mutable?) indicates whether the value can be changed after creation.
:::
::::




##  Python Basics
### Brackets

- There are several kinds of brackets in Python, including `[]`, `{}`, and `()`. 


::: {.panel-tabset}

## `[]`
- `[]` is used to denote a **list** or to signify accessing a *position* using an index.

```{.python}
vector = ['a', 'b']
vector[0]
```





## `{}`
- `{}` is used to denote a **set** or a **dictionary** (with key-value pairs).

```{.python}
{'a', 'b'}
{'first_letter': 'a', 'second_letter': 'b'}
```




## `()`
- `()` is used to denote a **tuple**, or the *arguments* to a *function*, e.g., function(x)  where x is the input passed to the function, or to indicate the order operations are carried out.

```{.python}
num_tup = (1, 2, 3)
sum(num_tup)
```



:::



##  Python Basics
### Lists and Slicing

- Lists are a really useful way to work with lots of data at once. 
  - We can also construct them by appending entries:

```{.python}
list_example = [10, 1.23, "like this", True, None]
list_example.append("one more entry")
print(list_example)
```

- We can access earlier entries using an *index*, which begins at 0 and ends at one less than the length of the list.

```{.python}
print(list_example[0])
print(list_example[-1])
```




##  Python Basics
### Lists and Slicing

- Slicing can be even more elaborate than that because we can jump entries using a second colon. 

```{.python}
# range() produces a list of integers from the value to one less than the last
list_of_numbers = list(range(1, 11))
start = 1
stop = -1
step = 2
print(list_of_numbers[ start : stop : step ])
```




##  Python Basics
### Operators

- All of the basic operators you see in mathematics are available to use: `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, `*` for multiplication, `**` for powers, `/` for division, `//` for integer division, and `%` for modulo.

  i. These work as you’d expect on numbers. 
  i. These operators are sometimes defined for other built-in data types too. 
    - We can ‘sum’ strings (which really concatenates them):

```{.python}
string_one = "This is an example "
string_two = "of string concatenation"
string_full = string_one + string_two
print(string_full)
```



##  Python Basics
### Operators

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- It works for lists too:

```{.python}
list_one = ["apples", "oranges"]
list_two = ["pears", "satsumas"]
list_full = list_one + list_two
print(list_full)
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- We can multiply strings!

```{.python}
string = "apples, "
print(string * 3)
```

:::
::::



##  Python Basics
### Operators

- We can combine the arithmetic operators with assignment by putting the operator before the `=`.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- `x += 1` is equivalent to `x = x + 1`.
```{.python}
x = 3
x += 1
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- `a -= 2` is equivalent to `a = a - 2`.
```{.python}
a = 2
a -= 2
```
:::
:::: 



##  Python Basics
### Operators

**Q**. Using Python operations only, what is
$$\frac{2^5}{7 \cdot (4 - 2^3)} \quad\text{?}$$ 






##  Python Basics
### Strings

- From strings, we can access the individual characters via slicing and indexing. 


```{.python}
string = "cheesecake"
print( string[-4:] )
```


- Both lists and strings will allow us to use the `len()` command to get their length:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- `x += 1` is equivalent to `x = x + 1`.
```{.python}
string = "cheesecake"
print( "String has length:" )
print( len(string) )
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- `a -= 2` is equivalent to `a = a - 2`.
```{.python}
list_of_numbers = range(1, 20)
print( "List of numbers has length:" )
print( len(list_of_numbers) )
```
:::
::::



##  Python Basics
### f-string

- `f-string` can combine a number and a string (these begin with an `f` for formatting):
```{.python}
value = 20
sqrt_val = 20 ** 0.5
print(f"The square root of {value:d} is {sqrt_val:.2f}")
```

- The formatting command `:d` is an instruction to treat value like an *integer*, while `:.2f` is an instruction to print it like a *float* with 2 decimal places.





##  Python Basics
### Booleans and Conditions

- Boolean data have either `True` or `False` value.


- There are two types of operation that are associated with booleans: boolean operations.
  - Existing booleans are combined, and condition operations, which create a boolean when executed.



```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
text_tbl <- data.frame(
  Operator = c("x and y", "x or y", "not x"),
  Description = c("Are x and y both True?",
"Is at least one of x and y True?",
"Is x False?")
  )


kable(text_tbl, format = "html") %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = T) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T) %>%
  kable_styling(html_font = 'sans-serif, helvetica, arial',
                bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed") )

```



##  Python Basics
### Booleans and Conditions

Conditions are expressions that evaluate as booleans. 

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
text_tbl <- data.frame(
  Operator = c("x == y", "x != y", "x > y", "x >= y", "x < y", "x <= y", "x is y"),
  Description = c("Is x equal to y?",
"Is x greater than y?",
"Is x greater than or equal to y?",
"Is x greater than or equal to y?",
"Is x less than y?",
"Is x less than or equal to y?",
"Is x the same object as y?" )
)

kable(text_tbl, format = "html") %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = T) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = T) %>%
  kable_styling(html_font = 'sans-serif, helvetica, arial',
                bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed") )

```



##  Python Basics
### Booleans and Conditions

- The `==` is an operator that compares the objects on either side and returns `True` if they have the same values

```{.python}
boolean_condition1 = 10 == 20
print(boolean_condition1)

boolean_condition2 = 10 == '10'
print(boolean_condition2)
```

**Q**. What does `not (not True)` evaluate to?





##  Python Basics
### Booleans and Conditions

- The real power of conditions comes when we start to use them in more complex examples, such as `if` statements.


```{.python}
name = "Geneseo"
score = 99

if name == "Geneseo" and score > 90:
    print("Geneseo, you achieved a high score.")

if name == "Geneseo" or score > 90:
    print("You could be called Geneseo or have a high score")

if name != "Geneseo" and score > 90:

### Booleans and Conditions

- Given that `==` and `!=` test for equality and not equal, respectively, you may be wondering what the keyword `is`  is for.
  - Remember that everything in Python is an object, and that values can be assigned to objects.
  - `==` and `!=` compare values, while `is` compare objects.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{.python}
name_list = ["Ada", "Adam"]
name_list_two = ["Ada", "Adam"]
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{.python}
# Compare values
print(name_list == name_list_two)

# Compare objects
print(name_list is name_list_two)
```

##  Python Basics
### Booleans and Conditions

- One of the most useful conditional keywords is `in`. 
  - This one must pop up ten times a day in most coders’ lives because it can pick out a variable or make sure something is where it’s supposed to be.


```{.python}
name_list = ["Lovelace", "Smith", "Hopper", "Babbage"]

print("Lovelace" in name_list)

print("Bob" in name_list)
```

**Q**. Check if “a” is in the string “Sun Devil Arena” using `in`. Is “a” in “Anyone”?




##  Python Basics
### Booleans and Conditions

- One conditional construct we're bound to use at some point, is the `if-else` chain:

```{.python}
score = 98

if score == 100:
    print("Top marks!")
elif score > 90 and score < 100:
    print("High score!")
elif score > 10 and score <= 90:
    pass
else:
    print("Better luck next time.")
```




##  Python Basics
### Booleans and Conditions


**Q**. Create a new `if-else` chain that prints “well done” if a score is over 90, “good” if between 40 and 90, and “bad luck” otherwise.






##  Python Basics
### Booleans and Conditions


- We can make multiple assignment or multiple boolean comparisons in a single line.


```{.python}
a, b = 3, 6

1 < a < b < 20
```
